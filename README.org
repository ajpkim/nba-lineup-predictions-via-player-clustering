* NBA Lineup Predictions with Player Clustering

The conclusion of this project is a simple neural network trained to predict NBA lineup point differentials per 100 possessions based on backward looking player clusters generated from a gaussian mixture model (fit on scraped player stats) and combined with the previous years [[https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html][box plus/minus]]. The best network achieved a mean test error of 5.6 points per 100 possessions. See [[https://ajpkim.com/projects/nba-lineup-predictions-with-clustering/][my site]] for a detailed project writeup.
