## Intro

The NBA has moved far beyond the times when the traditional five positions well-specified the playing style, role, and value of indivudal players. 


Perhaps these five position (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and the almighty center position) were never great descriptors of the game, nevertheless they were the dominant

and continue to frame how we conceptualize the game of basketball.


The taxonomy we use to describe components of a system necesarily structures our view of the elements we wish to describe. Our understanding of the whole - in this case basketball - is in large part defined by the tools and concepts - in this case the 5 traditional basketball position - we have for describing and understanding the system.


The positions are a traditional mental model of the structure of basketball. 


The labels we have allow for particular functional roles 

Tall basketball players player in the post, rebound well, do not dribble, and 

 So while we need structure for understanding and analaysis to get off the ground we should continually be aware of the ways that our scaffolding determines the the very things




In this project I clustered NBA player seasons into 12 clusters with the goal of grouping together player seasons with similar playing style (e.g. shot creation/selection/frequency), efficiency (e.g. true shooting percentage), and overall impact (e.g. box plus minus). These clusters represent a better grouping technique than the traditional 5-positions in basketball.

## The NBA: an evolving league

The NBA today is a fast moving landscape of player archetypes, player movement, team playing  styles, and team-building strategies [^1]. Even the rules are changing with great rapidity as replay has become more availble and players exploit the current boundaries of the game to hunt down advantages with increased focus (Harden, Lilliard). Bruising big men are out, three pointers are in, switchability is at a premium, championship equity is common parlance, and twitter burner accounts are just part of the price we pay for such an entertaining and competitive sports league [^2].  

<!-- How we watch and understand the game has necessarily shifted along with the movement of the game itself. The casual fan grimaces at the sight of their favorite team's young star electing to take difficult deep 2-pointers early in the shot clock. We have all seen the shot chart maps and now demand lean, healthy shot charts from players. -->

Many NBA front offices today are active experimentors, or at least willing followers of the innovators, in roster construction and player development. Having embraced new concepts, metrics, and aesthetics, teams trot out funky lineups, exploring different avenues to find any edge in a league overwhelming dominanted by singluar talent, if only for improved draft lottery odds [^3]. The willingness to explore the structure of basketball and employ new concepts in trying to understand the game is bound to uncover some interesting insights along with plenty of dead-ends.

As fans, how we watch and understand the game has been tugged along with the movement of the game itself. We have been force fed shot chart maps highlighting what a healthy shot diet consists in and now we grimace watching our favorite team's young star indulge in taking difficult deep 2-pointers early in the shot clock; a habit of certain stars of yesteryear. The previously niche lexicon of analytics has incrementally wedged intself into a central role in our watching, understanding, and debating.

And yet at the core of things remain the traditional 5 positions, unchanged for decades, and continuing to passively frame our expectatations, imagination, and understanding of basketball.  Positions are the most common currency of description when evaluating players and teams. Each one maps to a variety of functional roles, and these boundaries help us to organize and chunk of the game of basketball into useful components when playing, coaching, watching, and evaluating. Positions are indeed necessary, I am no basketball anarchist, but as with _everything_ we should be aware of the role these concepts play in shaping our understanding of the very thing they purport to describe.


<!-- Positions matter because they outline the possible functional roles on a team and it is generally demand that players tailor their game to suit the roles assigned to them by their position.  -->

The influence of the positional hierarchy is far-reaching. For example, many who played basketball growing up are familiar with the lazy assignment of the smallest kid to point guard and the biggest kid to center. This pigeon-holing is common, and reveals a pervasive unthinking adherence to traditional positional boxes as these coaches are unable to imagine the game played another way.

In the NBA today the best example of an over-discounted positional outlier is Ben Simmons. He is an elite defender, passer, and one-man transition engine, while refusing to shoot from distance. Each of his positive qualities taken alone are highly desirable but when combined in a single package with his shooting weaknesses the sum elicits great confusion and his value is questioned. He falls far outside our established frameworks for understanding the game, and thus to my mind is underrated by many fans.

<!-- Some players have been so transcendent that their positional unothodoxy was pardoned and even celebrated as part of their greatness. The Magic's, Barkeley's, and LeBron's of the league.
But for most players positional boundaries play a large role in constraing their potential contributions and skills to a specific shape.  -->

Main point:
- the 5 five traditional positions are a tired simplistic 


Positions help us organize the game and I am not a basketball anarchist 

But as with 






- say between point-guard and shooting-guard or small-forward and power-forward, that 













And yet some fundamental scaffolding from decades past continues to sit at heart of the game, the five traditional positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and the previously almighty center.




And yet our picture of the game is still disproportionately colored by a set of descriptors that dates back decades, the five traditional positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and the previously almighty center.






The traditional 5 positions reveal a clear mismatch between the growth of the game and the hierarchies of bygone eras.




All of this to say that I scraped and cleaned some data, ran some clustering algorithms, and tried to predict lineup success based on lineup cluster profile.



#### PJ TUCKER
PJ Tucker, all 6'5 of him, played just above a quarter of his minutes last season (2019-2020) at the center position,  regularly trading boxouts with men standing above 7 feet tall. What do we gain by calling 3-pt corner marksmen PJ Tucker a center? Not much.
